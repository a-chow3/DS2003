## DS2003

This course provides practical experiences about how data is commonly used in communication. The general objective is to familiarize one with how to effectively summarize and visualize data using R, with a particular focus on graphical presentations with the R visualization tools like ggplot2, Plotly, and Shiny. Additionally, there will be discussions about how graphs are used in our everyday lives and how, as data scientists, we can effectively, and ethically, display data for stakeholders. 

This repository examines the midterm and final projects Group 7 completed between Adam Chow, Jaelyn Do, Kevin Zhang, Jessica Li, and Chris Kim. Our first midterm project focused on MLB Ranks and Game Result data from 2012-2021 to answer specific research questions associated with winning. Our second project is a link below to our Shiny app, regarding World Happiness Data found from multiple Kaggle sources.
